The process is simple. We will guide you through it, and when needed, ask you to provide your credentials and authorize the data destination.

The flow, in a nutshell:

 - First, choose one of the E-Commerce source components: Shopify, WooCommerce, or BigCommerce based on your e-commerce platform. This selection will determine where the data extraction process will begin. The selected E-Commerce source component will collect data from your account (data about orders, products, and customers).
  
 - Next, we generate the output tables which will encompass information regarding orders, order lines, customers, and products. We add NULL values if any columns are missing.
  
 - We will also perform RFM (recency, frequency, and monetary) analysis over the data from the last 24 months as part of the information for each customer.
  
 - Optionally, the data will be written into a data destination of your choice.
  
 - Finally, you will run the entire flow (i.e., the sequence of all prepared, above mentioned steps, in the correct order). The selected E-Commerce source component, all data manipulations and analyses, and optionally, the destination component, will be processed.
