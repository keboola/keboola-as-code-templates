This process is straightforward, and we're here to guide you every step of the way. At certain points, we may prompt you to provide your credentials and authorize specific components.

Follow these steps:

1. Shopify Demo Data Creation:
- We'll begin by generating demo data from Shopify, covering aspects like orders, products, inventory, and customers.

2. Output Table Preparation:
- Next, we'll set up the output tables. If any columns are missing, we'll insert NULL values.
- We'll then verify the data quality and conduct an RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis.

3. Snowflake Data Integration:
- The processed data is subsequently written back into the Snowflake database using the Snowflake data destination component.

4. Configuration for Interactive Data App:
- We'll set up the necessary configuration for the Interactive Data App.

5. Executing the Workflow:
- At this point, you'll be responsible for running the entire process. This involves executing all the previously prepared steps in their designated sequence.
- The workflow incorporates the Shopify data source component, all data manipulations, analyses, the Snowflake destination component, and the deployment of the Data App.

6. Data App Deployment & Credential Entry:
- To wrap up, the Data App will be deployed. Following this, you'll need to provide Snowflake credentials to the app.
