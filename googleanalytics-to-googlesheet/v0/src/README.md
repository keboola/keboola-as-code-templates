The process is simple. We will guide you through it, and, when needed, ask you to set up your profile and authorize the source and destination components.
 
The flow, in a nutshell:
 
- First, the Google Analytics source component will collect data from your Google Analytics account, and the Google Search Console source component (if selected) will get your Google Search Console data. 

- Then we will put your data into the requested shape, and the Google Sheets destination component will load the results into a Google Sheets database.

- Finally, you will schedule and run the entire flow (i.e., the sequence of all the prepared, above mentioned steps, in the correct order). The Google Analytics or Google Search Console source components (if selected), all data manipulations, and the Google Sheets destination component, will be processed.
