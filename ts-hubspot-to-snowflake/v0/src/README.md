The process is simple. We will guide you through it, and, when needed, ask you to provide your credentials, select a date range, and authorize the data source and data destination components.

The flow, in a nutshell:

- First, the HubSpot data source component will collect data from your HubSpot account (companies, deals, activities, etc.). 

- Then we will put your data into the requested shape, and the Snowflake data destination component will load the results into a Snowflake database.

- Finally, you will schedule and run the entire flow (i.e., the sequence of all the prepared, above mentioned steps, in the correct order). The data source component, all data manipulations, and the Snowflake data destination component, will be processed.

- At this point, your data will be prepared to be loaded into SpotApps as a reporting source. Once you are in SpotApps, enter the credentials of the database where you store your newly created data, and you can start using your reporting right away.
