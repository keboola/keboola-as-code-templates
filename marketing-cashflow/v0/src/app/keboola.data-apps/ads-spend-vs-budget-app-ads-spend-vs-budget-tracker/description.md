This Data App visualizes the campaign spending across various advertising platforms. It displays both the total budget and the budget spend per client on different advertising platforms. Additionally, the app provides users with the capability to input or modify budgets for specific clients and choose the advertising platforms for which those budgets will be applied. These changes are promptly saved to storage and become accessible for subsequent data refreshes from advertising campaigns
