### The flow in a nutshell:

- Data structure preparation - defines a table structure called "campaign_budget" with columns that can store information related to campaign budgets, including source identifiers, client names, budget names, budget amounts, currency, start and end dates, and potentially a large text field for campaign-related information.
Data extractions - here, you will select one or multiple data sources (extractors) that will provide all available data.
- LinkedIn Transformation - performs several operations to transform and join data from multiple tables related to LinkedIn campaigns, statistics and costs into a single linkedin table for further analysis or reporting. It involves multiple data transformations, column extractions, and joins between different tables to achieve the result. The data from linkedin table is incrementally loaded into ads_insight_fact.
- Google Ads Transformation - performs several operations. It creates a table called google with 25 columns and inserts data into it from the google_ads, google_campaign, and google_customer tables. The data is filtered to only include records with a segmentsDate greater than 2023-01-01.
Sklik Transformation - performs several operations. It creates a table called `ads_insight_fact ` with the defined columns. It then inserts data into the table from the `sklik_ads-stats`, `sklik_ads`, `sklik_accounts`, and `sklik_campaign` tables.
- TikTok Transformation - performs several operations. It creates a table called ads_insight_fact with 25 columns and inserts data into it from the tiktok_ad, tiktok_adgroup, and tiktok_campaign tables.
- Meta Transformation - performs several operations. It creates a table called meta with 26 columns and inserts data into it from input tables. The data is incrementally inserted into the ads_insight_fact table by selecting values from the other tables and performing calculations on them.
- Data App Deployment - This Data App visualizes the campaign spending across various advertising platforms. It displays both the total budget and the budget spend per client on different advertising platforms. Additionally, the app provides users with the capability to input or modify budgets for specific clients and choose the advertising platforms for which those budgets will be applied. These changes are promptly saved to storage and become accessible for subsequent data refreshes from advertising campaigns
