### Data Profiling

Our Data Profiling solution is an automated tool designed to assess the quality and structure of your datasets, ensuring accurate, reliable, and actionable insights. By analyzing incoming data tables, it provides a comprehensive overview of the data’s health and highlights potential issues that could impact downstream processes.

## Key Benefits for Business Users:

* **Column Overview:** Automatically identifies all columns, their data types (numeric, text, date, or mixed), and provides short, understandable descriptions of their contents.

* **Data Completeness:** Detects missing or empty values and quantifies their impact, flagging areas that require attention.

* **Consistency Checks:** Identifies columns with inconsistent data types, duplicate rows, or invalid date formats to prevent errors in analysis and reporting.

* **Statistical Insights:** Calculates basic statistics like minimum, maximum, average, and median for numeric columns, helping to spot anomalies or unusual patterns.

* **Outlier Detection:** Flags extreme or unusual values in numeric fields to prevent them from skewing results.

* **Actionable Reporting:** Generates a structured summary of all tests and their results, categorized by severity, providing clear guidance for data improvement.

By automating these checks, the script ensures your data is trustworthy, reduces manual validation effort, and supports better decision-making across the organization.
