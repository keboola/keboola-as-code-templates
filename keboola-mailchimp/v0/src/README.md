The process is simple. We will guide you through it, and, when needed, ask you to provide your credentials and authorize the destination component.

The flow, in a nutshell:

- First, the MailChimp source component will collect data from your account: lists of campaigns, members and lists. 

- Then we prepare five tables (campaign, campaign-event, customer, list, list-member) that can be used to visualize results. 

- The data is then written into a database of your choice.

- Finally, you will schedule and run the entire flow (i.e., the sequence of all the prepared, above mentioned steps, in the correct order). The survey source component, all data manipulations, and the destination component, will be processed.
