## Description:
This orchestrator is getting data from Shopify Extractor, transforming them, running RFM analysis and writing data into Snowflake database. Altough it's not that simple, some steps have to be done before starting this orchestrator. 
1. Setting up shopify extractor: adding credentials
2. Setting up Snowflake database: create snowflake database provided by Keboola

Once both steps above are done, start this orchestration.
