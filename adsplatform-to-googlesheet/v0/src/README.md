The process is simple. We will guide you through it, and, when needed, ask you to provide your credentials and authorize the data destination.

The flow, in a nutshell:

- First, you will select one or multiple data source components that will provide all your available data about your campaigns. 

- To enrich the marketing model with keywords, ad groups, and marketing transactions, you can also bring in your Google Analytics data (data about basic sessions and transactions). 

- The data extracted from the ad platform or platforms will be placed into one output table containing basic information about campaigns, impressions, clicks, costs, and cost conversions. 

- Then, optionally, Google Analytics sessions (new and returns), page views, and bounces will be added to the output table, and two new tables will be created for transactions and keyword ad groups.

- The data will be written into a Google Sheets account via the Google Sheets destination component.

- Finally, you will run the entire flow (i.e., the sequence of all the prepared, above mentioned steps, in the correct order). All your selected source components, all data manipulations, and the Google Sheets destination component, will be processed.
