The DataHub template template provides a one-click setup of an end-to-end flow for populating Keboola metadata into a DataHub data catalog. This includes extracting data from both the Telemetry and Metadata extractors before transforming the data to calculate table properties and lineage. You can choose whether or not to include schemas, properties, or tags from the DataHub writer.
