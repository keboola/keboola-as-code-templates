After selecting this template, you will be asked to authorize Shopify and any of the ad platforms that you use to allow the data source components to access your data.

Then, choose between Snowflake and BigQuery as the way to deliver data to Thoughtspot Embrace or Thoughtspot Cloud. Have your database credentials with write privileges ready for the setup wizard.

Don’t have your own data warehouse yet? No worries, follow [these instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_7DRa7KdeXT1ZZ22ENDxW4fDO1BL_n8uTqhiSQms2pE/edit?usp=sharing) to get one provided by Keboola.

The resulting flow will contain the selected data Source components that connect to your platforms, set of transformations to create the data model, and a database writer to populate the data warehouse of your choice.

All that is left then is to set up the connection in Thoughtspot and, if you haven’t done so yet, install the Shopify Analytics by Keboola TML block from CodeSpot.
