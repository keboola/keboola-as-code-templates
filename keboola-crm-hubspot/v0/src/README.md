The process is simple. We will guide you through it, and, when needed, ask you to provide your credentials and authorize the source and destination components.
 
The flow, in a nutshell:

- First, the HubSpot source component will collect data from your HubSpot account (companies, deals, activities, etc.). 

- Then we will put your data into the requested shape.

- Optionally, you can load the results into one of the provided destinations.

- Finally, you will schedule and run the entire flow (i.e., the sequence of all the prepared, above mentioned steps, in the correct order). The HubSpot source component, all data manipulations, and optionally, the destination component, will be processed.
