The process is simple. We will guide you through it, and, when needed, ask you to provide your credentials, and authorize the source and destination components.
 
The flow, in a nutshell:

- First, the Typeform source component will collect data from your Typeform account: lists of forms, questions, and responses, and basic form statistics.

- We then prepare four tables (surveys, questions, answer options, and responses) that can be used to visualize survey results.

- Optionally, the data is then written into a data destination of your choice.

- Finally, you will schedule and run the entire flow (i.e., the sequence of all the prepared, above mentioned steps, in the correct order). The Typeform source component, all data manipulations, and optionally, the destination component, will be processed.
