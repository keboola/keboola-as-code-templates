The process is simple. We will guide you through it, and, when needed, ask you to provide your credentials and authorize the destination component.
 
The flow, in a nutshell: 
 
- First, we create Shopify demo data (data about orders, products, inventory, and customers). You can also bring in your real marketing data from your Facebook Ads, Google Ads, and/or Sklik accounts.
 
- We then create the output tables. We add NULL values if any columns are missing. We also check the data, and perform an RFM analysis. 
 
- The data is then written into a Snowflake database via the Snowflake destination component. 
 
- Finally, you will run the entire flow (i.e., the sequence of all the prepared, above mentioned steps, in the correct order). The Shopify source component, all data manipulations and analyses, and the Snowflake destination component, will be processed.
