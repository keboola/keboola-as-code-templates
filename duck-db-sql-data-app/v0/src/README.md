### DuckDB SQL Data App

This application provides a single workspace for working with company data in DuckDB.

It enables you to:

* Upload and prepare data – automatically loads CSV or Parquet files, converts them into an optimized format, and displays a list of available tables.

* Explore your data – view table structures, row counts, column types, basic statistics, and data previews.

* Write and run SQL queries – create custom queries on loaded tables, execute them, and download the results.

* Use ready-made queries – quickly get started with sample SQL queries for filtering, aggregation, and statistics.

* Migrate between platforms – built-in tool converts Snowflake SQL queries to DuckDB SQL, speeding up platform transitions.

* Work in multiple steps – run multiple queries at once, choose which ones to execute, and see results with clear metrics such as runtime and row counts.

The result is a fast, secure, and intuitive environment for working with data, simplifying analysis preparation and migration from other SQL platforms.
