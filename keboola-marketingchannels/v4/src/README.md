The process is simple. We will guide you through it, and, when needed, ask you to authorize the source and destination components.

The flow, in a nutshell:

- First, you will select one or multiple source components that will provide all your available data about your campaigns. 

- The data extracted from the ad platform or platforms will be placed into one output table containing basic information about campaigns, impressions, clicks, costs, and cost conversions.

- Optionally, the data will be written into a destination of your choice or you can use data app with online marketing dashboard.

- Finally, you will run the entire flow (i.e., the sequence of all the prepared, above mentioned steps, in the correct order). All your selected source components, all data manipulations, and optionally, the destination component, will be processed.
