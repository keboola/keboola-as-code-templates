The process is simple. We will guide you through it, and, when needed, ask you to authorize the source and destination components.

The flow, in a nutshell:

- First, you will select one or multiple source components that will provide all your available data about your campaigns. 

- To enrich the marketing model with keywords, ad groups, and marketing transactions, you can also bring in your Google Analytics data (data about basic sessions and transactions). 

- The data extracted from the ad platform or platforms will be placed into one output table containing basic information about campaigns, impressions, clicks, costs, and cost conversions.

- Then, optionally, Google Analytics sessions (new and returns), page views, and bounces will be added to the output table, and two new tables will be created for transactions and keyword ad groups.

- Optionally, the data will be written into a destination of your choice or you can use data app with online marketing dashboard.

- Finally, you will run the entire flow (i.e., the sequence of all the prepared, above mentioned steps, in the correct order). All your selected source components, all data manipulations, and optionally, the destination component, will be processed.
