The process is simple. We will guide you through it, and, when needed, ask you to provide your credentials and authorize the destination component.
 
The flow, in a nutshell: 
 
- First, the Shopify source component will collect data from your Shopify account (data about orders, products, inventory, and customers). You can also bring in marketing data from your Facebook Ads, Google Ads, and/or Sklik accounts.
 
- We then create the output tables. We add NULL values if any columns are missing. We also check the data, and perform an RFM analysis. 
 
- The data is then written into a Google sheet via the Google Sheets destination component. 
 
- Finally, you will run the entire flow (i.e., the sequence of all the prepared, above mentioned steps, in the correct order). The Shopify source component, all data manipulations and analyses, and the Google Sheets destination component, will be processed.
