This transformation creates several tables with aggregated data on sessions, users, and transactions. It performs several transformations to analyze user behavior and session data from Google Analytics 4 (GA4) and Universal Analytics (UA) data sources. The script is quite complex, involving multiple steps of data transformation and aggregation to derive insights from raw data. Finally it created the table `COMPARISON` where all the cleaned and transformed data are joined for further use.
